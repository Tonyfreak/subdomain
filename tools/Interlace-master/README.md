## Further information regarding ports

| Example | Notation Type                                            |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 80      | Single port                                              |
| 1-80    | Dash notation, perform a command for each port from 1-80 |
| 80,443  | Perform a command for both port 80, and port 443         |

## Further information regarding targets
Both `-t` and `-tL` will be processed the same. You can pass targets the same as you would when using nmap. This can be done using CIDR notation, dash notation, or a comma-delimited list of targets. A single target list file can also use different notation types per line.

Alternatively, you can pass targets in via STDIN and neither -t or -tL will be required.

# Variable Replacements
The following variables will be replaced in commands at runtime:

| Variable  | Replacement                                                             |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \_target\_  | Replaced with the expanded target list that the current thread is running against  |
| \_cleantarget\_  | Replaced with target cleanded from http:// or https://  |
| \_host\_ | Works the same as \_target\_, and can be used interchangeably |
| \_output\_   | Replaced with the output folder variable from Interlace              |
| \_port\_     | Replaced with the expanded port variable from Interlace                       |
| \_realport\_ | Replaced with the real port variable from Interlace                  |
| \_proxy\_    | Replaced with the proxy list from Interlace |
| \_random\_   | Replaced with the randomly chosen file from Interlace | 

# Advanced Command File Usage
Interlace also makes the use of two additional features for controlling execution flow within a command file: `_blocker_` and `_block:<name>_`. Blockers prevent execution of commands listed after them, until all commands before them have completed, and blocks can be used to force sequential execution of commands listed within a block, for a target.

These are run on a per-target level. If there are threads available and a blocker is in the way for the current target, Interlace will start commands from the next target within a target list in order to maximise efficiency.

Using these features will allow you to control the execution flow for individual targets more directly in order to prevent commands from running out of order.

## Blocker
Blockers prevent anything below them from executing until all commands above them have completed (for the currently active host). For example, in the following:

```
mkdir -p _output_/_target_/scans/
_blocker_
nmap _target_ -oA _output_/_target_/scans/_target_-nmap
```

The use of a blocker here prevents nmap from running on a target before the base folder structure has been created, preventing nmap from throwing an exception.

## Blocks
Blocks force everything within them to run sequentially. You can also use multiple blocks per command file. For example, in the following:

```
_block:nmap_
mkdir -p _target_/output/scans/
nmap _target_ -oN _target_/output/scans/_target_-nmap
_block:nmap_
nikto --host _target_
```
In this example, the block would run the same as before, but assuming the thread count is high enough then nikto would begin to run immediately, passing results back to the terminal (whilst nmap and file creation happened in the background).

# Usage Examples
## Run Nikto Over Multiple Sites
Let's assume that you have a file `targets.txt`  that has the following contents:

```
bugcrowd.com
hackerone.com
```
You could use Interlace to run over any number of targets within this file using:
bash
```
➜  /tmp interlace -tL ./targets.txt -threads 5 -c "nikto --host _target_ > ./_target_-nikto.txt" -v

[14:33:23] [THREAD] [nikto --host hackerone.com > ./hackerone.com-nikto.txt] Added to Queue 
[14:33:23] [THREAD] [nikto --host bugcrowd.com > ./bugcrowd.com-nikto.txt] Added to Queue 
```
This would run Nikto over each host and save to a file for each target. Note that in the above example since we're using the `>` operator, the results won't be fed back to the terminal; however this is desired functionality as otherwise we wouldn't be able to attribute which target Nikto results were returning for.

For applications where you desire feedback, simply pass commands as you normally would (or use `tee`).

## Run Nikto Over Multiple Sites and Ports
Using the above example, let's assume you want independent scans to be run for both ports `80` and `443` for the same targets. You would then use the following:

```
➜  /tmp interlace -tL ./targets.txt -threads 5 -c "nikto --host _target_:_port_ > ./_target_-_port_-nikto.txt" -p 80,443 -v

```
## Run a List of Commands against Target Hosts
Often with penetration tests, there's a list of commands you want to run on nearly every job. Assuming that list includes testssl.sh, nikto, and sslscan, you could save a command list with the following in a file called `commands.txt`:

```
nikto --host _target_:_port_ > _output_/_target_-nikto.txt
sslscan _target_:_port_ >  _output_/_target_-sslscan.txt
testssl.sh _target_:_port_ > _output_/_target_-testssl.txt
```
If you were then given a target `example.com`, you could run each of these commands against this target using the following:
```bash
interlace -t example.com -o ~/Engagements/example/ -cL ./commands.txt -p 80,443
```
This would then run nikto, sslscan, and testssl.sh for both port 80 and 443 against example.com and save the files into your engagements folder.

## CIDR notation with an application that doesn't support it
Interlace automatically expands CIDR notation when starting threads (unless the `--no-cidr` flag is passed). This allows you to pass CIDR notation to a variety of applications:

To run a virtual host scan against every target within `192.168.12.0/24` using a direct command you could use:
```bash
interlace -t 192.168.12.0/24 -c "vhostscan _target_ -oN _output_/_target_-vhosts.txt" -o ~/scans/ -threads 50
```
This is despite VHostScan not having any in-built CIDR notation support. Since Interlace expands the notation before building a queue of threads, VHostScan for all intents is only receiving a list of direct IP addresses to scan.

## Glob notation with an application that doesn't support it
Interlace automatically expands glob ranges when starting threads. This allows you to pass glob ranges to a variety of applications:

To run a virtual host scan against every target within `192.168.12.*` using a direct command you could use:
```bash
interlace -t 192.168.12.* -c "vhostscan _target_ -oN _output_/_target_-vhosts.txt" -o ~/scans/ -threads 50
```
Yet again, VHostScan does not have any inbuilt glob range format support.

## Dash (-) notation with an application that doesn't support it
Interlace automatically expands dash ranges when starting threads. This allows you to pass glob ranges to a variety of applications:

To run a virtual host scan against every target within `192.168.12.1-15` using a direct command you could use:
```bash
interlace -t 192.168.12.1-15 -c "vhostscan _target_ -oN _output_/_target_-vhosts.txt" -o ~/scans/ -threads 50
```
Yet again, VHostScan does not have any inbuilt dash range format support.


## Threading Support for an application that doesn't support it
Run a [virtual host scan](https://github.com/codingo/VHostScan) against each host in a file (`target-lst.txt`), whilst also limiting scans at any one time to 50 maximum threads.

This could be done using a direct command:
```bash
interlace -tL ./target-list.txt -c "vhostscan -t _target_ -oN _output_/_target_-vhosts.txt" -o ~/scans/ -threads 50
```

Or, alternatively, to run the same command as above, but using a command file:
```bash
interlace -cL ./vhosts-commands.txt -tL ./target-list.txt -threads 50 -o ~/scans
```
This presumes that the content of the command file is:
```
vhostscan -t $target -oN _output_/_target_-vhosts.txt
```
This would output a file for each target in the specified output folder. You could also run multiple commands simply by adding them into the command file.

## Exclusions
Interlace automatically excludes any hosts provided when specified via the `-e` or `-eL` arguments. These arguments are also compatible with the range notations mentioned above (CIDR, glob, and dash)

To run a virtual host scan against every target in the CIDR range `192.168.12.0/24` but not for the targets in the range `192.168.12.0/26`, using a direct command, you could use:
```bash
interlace -t 192.168.12.0/24 -e 192.168.12.0/26 -c "vhostscan _target_ -oN _output_/_target_-vhosts.txt" -o ~/scans/ -threads 50
```

## Run Nikto Using Multiple Proxies
Using the above example, let's assume you want independent scans to be via different proxies for the same targets. You would then use the following:

```
➜  /tmp interlace -tL ./targets.txt -pL ./proxies.txt -threads 5 -c "nikto --host _target_:_port_ -useproxy _proxy_ > ./_target_-_port_-nikto.txt" -p 80,443 -v
```
